# Case Study Proposal: Global X Change

## What Is It
Global X Change is a Canadian Financial Technology company that has created the world's first Exchange Operating System (ExchangeOS). This client-side operating system allows users, exchange operators, token issuers, brokers, and liquidity providers to interact with each other. This system is called the Global X Change Operating System (GXOS)and is made up of several Exchange Apps and Exchange Dapps.
To distribute the GXOS, the company has created the GXBroker. GXBroker gives anyone the ability to launch an online cryptocurrency brokerage business by leveraging the GXOS. There are 1000â€™s of GXBrokers in over 87 countries who are getting paid to facilitate all types of cryptocurrency transactions.
The Global X Change Operating System (GXOS) is a collection of ExchangenApps and Exchange Dapps which are tied together through an integrated user experience.


## Why This Matters
In normal circumstances, to launch a broker firm several steps are required that are considered mandatory. Initially, you need to take the exam in Canada or a related exam in a particular country, just to qualify to open their broker firm. Afterward, the process of registering the Stockbroker is tiresome and brokers are supposed to continue with their education to make sure that they are compliant with the industry standards. 
In contrast, using GlobalXChange is far better, as the broker can concentrate on the business than other activities, including worrying about compliance checks, security issues, and many more. On the other hand, people who only have on-job experience instead of high-level education can also benefit from this as the requirement to complete an exam just to start a business also goes away.
Furthermore, a major benefit of using GlobalXChange is that you have the network of clients that you want from all over the world instead of getting it from one particular nation, giving a justifiable meaning to global-village interactions.


## Why This May be Interesting
GlobalXChange is on the incline of changing the game with regards to giving admittance to the computerized monetary exchange business. Not exclusively was GlobalXChange quick to be administratively supported by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) for its Underlying Coin Offering (ICO), yet in addition, was quick to be administratively endorsed for its vision of making an optional commercial center for trading advanced protections through its partner GXBroker. GlobalXChange might make an immense, secure, and administrative agreeable environment for privately owned businesses to raise capital just as permitting financial backers to exchange advanced protections of these privately owned businesses. Along these lines, GlobalXChange could turn into a major name player in the Canadian advanced digital money transfer space.
